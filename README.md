# A simple React Component wrapping the
# [Keen.io JS SDK](https://github.com/keen/keen-js)

## Installation

```
npm install --save react-keenio
```
## Usage

You have to supply a client, a query and a chartType as props.
Furthermore all other configuration options found from the
[keen.io visualization docs](https://github.com/keen/keen-js/blob/master/docs/visualization.md#configuration)
are supported.

Also, check out the demo in the `example` folder.

## Development

Clone the repo, `npm install` also in the example dir.
Now you can run the example and modifications to the chart component will be reflected in it after you build it :)
